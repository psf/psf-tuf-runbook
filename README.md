psf-tuf-runbook
===============

This repository contains a runbook and supporting program for the Python Software Foundation's
TUF key generation and signing ceremonies.

**Due to COVID-19, this document has been modified for a two person, remote ceremony.**

## Notation

This document is designed to be read as a *runbook* -- a collection of discrete instructions
with remediation steps that, if followed correctly, should result in the intended effects.

We use the following notation:

* **DO** *actions*: Perform the following actions.
* **IF** *condition* **THEN** *actions*: If *condition* is met, then perform the following *actions*.
* **GO TO** *heading*: Go to the referenced heading in the runbook and perform the stated actions
thereon.
* **END**: You've reached an end state.

1. **DO GO TO** [Start](#start)

## Start

1. **DO GO TO** [Prepare the environment](#prepare-the-environment).

## Provisioning the YubiHSM 2

1. **DO** locate and write down the serial number printed on the YubiHSM 2. Refer to the picture below:

    ![A YubiHSM 2](./assets/yubihsm2.jpg)

    In this picture, the serial number is `7550054`. Note that in later steps the serial number will
    be 0-padded to 10 digits, like `0007550054`.

1. **IF** the YubiHSM 2 is being reprovisioned due to a compromise or failed ceremony, **THEN** you
must perform a physical reset.

    1. **DO** touch and hold the metal contact of the YubiHSM 2 for ten (10) seconds as you insert
    it into the trusted offline computer.

1. **IF** the YubiHSM 2 is being provisioned for the first time, **THEN** insert it into the trusted
offline computer.

1. **DO** ensure that exactly 1 (one) YubiHSM 2 is inserted into the trusted offline computer.

1. **DO** run the `yubihsm-provision` binary, using your key type according to the following rules:

    * **IF** your keytype is "P-256", **THEN** pass `--type p256`
    * **IF** your keytype is "P-384", **THEN** pass `--type p384`

    ```bash
    $ yubihsm-provision --type KEY-TYPE
    ```

1. **DO** wait for this prompt:

    ```
    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    !!!                    DANGER!                    !!!
